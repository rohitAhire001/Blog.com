        <p>“India has got a rich cultural heritage of “Unity in Diversity”, the roots of which are inextricably founded
            on the principle of 
            “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam”, meaning that the entire universe is a family
            At the time of India’s independence in 1947, it was however divided into more than 560 princely states and
            it was India’s first Deputy Prime Minister,
            Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who with his firm determination, could transform such imperialism
            into today’s unified India. People of India will 
            remain indebted to him forever for his leadership during the freedom struggle and his vision, wisdom and
            statesmanship in the post-independence era. His life
            is an eternal source of inspiration for the present as well as future generations and it is in this context
            that his iconic monumental statue – 
            the world’s tallest Statue of Unity has been dedicated to the Nation on the 143rd Birth Anniversary.</p>
