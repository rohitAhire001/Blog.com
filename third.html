        <p>The predominantly mountainous region comprising the present-day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since
            pre-historic times having witnessed multiple waves of human migrations from other areas.[19] Through its
            history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms some of which accepted the suzerainty of larger
            empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of Punjab
            Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief
            Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of
            neighboring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.

            Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Around 90% of the
            state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important
            constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the
            households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state
            in 2016.[20] According to a survey of CMS â€“ India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least
            corrupt state.[21][22]</p>
