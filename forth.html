        <h1>RAMEN</h1>
        <p>The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese lāmiàn (拉麵, "pulled noodles").[2][3] However,
            historian Barak Kushner argues that this borrowing occurred retroactively and that various independent
            Japanese corruptions of Chinese words had already led to Japanese people calling this Chinese noodle dish
            "ramen".[4] One theory suggests that the Japanese mistook the Chinese particles "le" (了) or "la" (啦, a
            contraction of 了啊)[4] for a "ra" sound when Chinese cooks would announce "hăo le" (好了) to communicate that a
            dish was complete. The Japanese then appended the word "men" (麵, meaning 'noodle') to the "ra" to create the
            word "ramen".[5] Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as Nankin soba (南京そば,
            literally "Nanjing soba", named after the city which was the then capital of China), Shina soba (支那そば,
            literally "Chinese soba"), or Chūka soba (中華そば, also meaning "Chinese soba").[6][4][5] Until the 1950s,
            ramen was most commonly called Shina soba, but today Chūka soba or just ramen (ラーメン) are more common, as the
            word "支那" (Shina, meaning "China") has acquired a pejorative connotation through its association with
            Japanese imperialism.[7]

            Origin
            Ramen is a Japanese[8] adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups[9][10][11][12][13] and was first recorded to
            have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown.[14][15] Although the ramen takes its name from lāmiàn, it does not
            actually evolve from the northern Chinese dish of lamian. The noodles used in ramen known as "chūkamen" are
            cut rather than hand-pulled.[4] The ramen is derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes such as the char
            siu tangmian of Guangdong and the rousi tangmian[16][5][6] of Jiangnan.[17] This is reflective of Yokohama
            Chinatown's demographics, as most Chinese settlers in the district came from the cities of Guangzhou and
            Shanghai.[18][19]]</p>
